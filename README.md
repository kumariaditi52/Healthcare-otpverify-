## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** installed on your system.
2. **MongoDB** server running locally or a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
3. Nodemailer credentials for OTP services.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RickyHarish/healthcare.git
   cd healthcare
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI= "Your Mongodb URI"
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER="Your Email Id"
EMAIL_PASS=Your password

HOST = smtp.gmail.com
SERVICE = gmail
EMAIL_PORT = 587
SECURE = false

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=adminaccesslogin
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=adminrefreshlogin

USER = "Your Email Id"
PASS = "Your app password" 

For creating PASS. Go to google manage your google accounts go to security, turn on that 2-step verification. Then search for app passwords give google your password. Type your app name and click on create. You will get 16 random characters. Use them for PASS without removing the spaces.
     
     ```

4. Run the development server:
   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```
